# This is a universally codeveloped devmenu for project Donetsk
This is meant for use in modded versions of Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2019, specifically the one from the OfflineGames discord server

# How do I download it?
You can download the entire repo via zip or download just the devgui_mp.cfg from it's page

# How do I use it?
If the menu is named devgui_mp.cfg it will permanently stay loaded, you can manually load it with "exec devgui_mp.cfg"

# How do I contribute?
Make a pull request and state what you want added/removed, If I see it fit to be added then it will be added
There are guidelines for adding to it though
1. No malicious commands that harm other people can be used
This one is pretty self explanatory
2. It has to be fit to be added
If it serves no purpose then it might as well not be added
3. It has to actually work properly
This one is pretty self explanatory as well, If it's basically useless then it might as well not be merged
